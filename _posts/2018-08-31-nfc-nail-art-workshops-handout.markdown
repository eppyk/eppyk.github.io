### Please read before starting your nail art adventure!
	
#### Overall tips

- Make sure none of the gel nail polish touches your cuticles or finger before you cure it – if it does, it will make it last less time. If you see the polish touching the skin, you can remove excess with the wooden stick provided.
	
- If you're using fake nails, you don't need to use base coat on the fake nail - just stick the LED / data tag and cover with chosen colour and a top coat. The fake nail should be glued directly to your nail.

- If needed, you can file the fake nails before gluing them on to make them match your nail shape better.

	
#### Just before you paint your nails or glue on fake ones

- Use wooden sticks provided to push back your cuticles to maximise the working area on your nail.

- Use cleaner and dust-free wadding swabs to cleanse your nails and finger tops from any oils. CAUTION: the cleaner is mostly alcohol, so if you have any cuts / pulled cuticles it can sting!

	
#### Let’s get painting

- If you skipped number 2, do these two things now : - )
	
- Put on a coat of **base nail polish** and cure under the UV lamp for 60 seconds.

- In order to glue on the fake nail, data tag or nail glue, apply the glue to your nail and wait for 5 seconds before applying the accessory.

- Using the provided nail glue, place a data tag / LED sticker on your nail and keep immobile until it dries enough to stop moving.

- Cover the tag with **colour polish** and cure under the UV lamp for 60 seconds.

- Put on a coat of **top coat nail polish** and cure under the UV lamp for the 60 seconds.

- If you wish, you can use any regular nail polish on top of the top UV coat – you should be able to freely remove it with acetone-free nail polish remover without affecting the gel manicure underneath as well.


#### How to remove gel manicure?

There has been plenty written on this before, so just read up on here: https://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Gel-Nail-Polish . tldr;  soak in acetone nail polish remover (get in it at any chemist, Boots or Superdrug).

You can skip the nail buffing - why? Learn from our nail guru Cristine: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1b_Fnz-aIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1b_Fnz-aIk)


#### Where do I get all the cool NFC stickers?

The maker shop Pimoroni is there to fill all your NFC sticker needs - they are currently (as of 1st Sept 2018) out of small data tags, but I think they should be coming back soon.
