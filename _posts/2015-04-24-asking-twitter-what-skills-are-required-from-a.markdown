# Some time ago, counting on my recently grown network of great people met @ PyCon 2015, I tweeted this open question to unveil the mystery which has grown around the position of a junior Python developer. **So, what exactly is expected? **




Take a look at the responses I got.

The main requirement which is clearly visible in most answers is the "desire to learn". It sounds very positive, but also a bit confusing; how can you measure and / or express a real desire to learn? I'd say being self-taught, developing own projects and (of course) involvement in open source would be some safe guesses. Let me know what you think, either here on on Twitter!
