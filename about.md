<h2> üëã I'm Kinga. </h2>

I study cyber security & digital forensics in Edinburgh, Scotland, with the hope of
one day becoming a <i> real security or forensics person<i>.

My main interests lay within digital forensics - I've completed a research internship
in Windows RAM forensics at my university and am currently working on my honours
dissertation about centralised thumbnail caches in macOS.

In the past I've worked for [Zonefox](https://www.zonefox.com/){:target="_blank"}
doing *all the things* from front end development to cloud traffic monitoring in AWS.
I've also toured the UAE with [Edinburgh Science](https://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}
\- previously Edinburgh International Science Festival - showing students the
magic of cyber security and prepping them for [a nation-wide competition](https://cyberquest.ae/en).

Additionally, over the years I've been involved in the organisation and teaching
at various [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/){:target="_blank"} events,
as well as [PyCon PL](https://pl.pycon.org/){:target="_blank"},
[PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2019/){:target="_blank"}
and [PyWaw Summit](http://summit.pywaw.org/2015/){:target="_blank"}.
